Homework of CSE 644 - Internet Security

! ! ! READ CAREFULLY ! ! !

This course is very meaningful but also challenging. (If you don't want to spend much time on it, I suggest to listen without enrollment.) A wide range of topics are included, which are helpful for deep understanding of computer networking and security.

Due to the strict grading standards, in fact some of these reports also have been deducted a lot of points. I highly recommend [this repository](https://github.com/wuyuMk7/everything/tree/master/courses/su/cse644) for detailed explanation and guidance.
